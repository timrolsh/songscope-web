- idea for engagement is on the homepage show recent activity and what people have been doing like rating songs and commenting and replying and what not.
- for your own account show stuff that is related to you like replies to your comments and likes of your own comments or something like that but compact the other people have liked your post notification because if too many people like it then the event will be too much

for users to do a log in with spotify and then have their own playlists use this:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization

for general spotify api that we will run on the backend for the people who aren't logged in with spotify we will use: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started

maybe add functionality to follow other users and view their profiles and message them but this could be like a later on idea

implement thing where if user logs in with spotify then they access everything themselves from the frontend but if they aren't logged in then we (the web server) have to do it for them
